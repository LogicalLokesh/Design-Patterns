# Momento Pattern Exercise

In the Exercise project, There is a application that represents a document in a word processor
like MS Word or Apple Pages.

Our Document class has three attributes:

- content
- fontName
- fontSize

We should allow the user to undo the changes to any of these
attributes. In the future, we may add additional attributes in this
class and these attributes should also be un-doable.
Implement the undo feature using the memento pattern.
