# Memento Pattern

The Memento pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides the ability to capture and restore an object's internal state without violating encapsulation. It allows an object to be restored to its previous state, thus enabling undo/redo operations.

## Key Components

The Memento pattern involves the following key components:

- Originator: This is the object whose state needs to be saved and restored.
It creates a memento object to store its state and can also use the memento to restore its state.
- Memento: This is the object that stores the state of the originator. It provides methods for getting and setting the state of the originator.
- Caretaker: This is the object responsible for storing and managing the mementos. It can request the originator to save its state or restore it from a memento.

## How It Works

The Memento pattern works as follows -

1. The originator creates a memento object and passes its current state to the memento.
2. The originator can also use the memento to restore its state if needed.
3. The caretaker can request the originator to save its state by creating a memento and storing it.
4. If the caretaker needs to restore the state of the originator, it retrieves the appropriate memento from its storage and passes it back to the originator for restoration.

## Benefits and Use Cases

The Memento pattern offers several benefits, including:

- It allows for easy restoration of an object's previous state, which is particularly useful in scenarios where undo/redo operations are required.
- It ensures that the internal state of an object is not exposed to other objects, maintaining encapsulation.
The Memento pattern is commonly used in applications that require undo/redo functionality, such as text editors, drawing programs, or any application where maintaining a history of states is essential.

## Conclusion

The Memento pattern provides a mechanism to capture and store an object's state and restore it when necessary. It promotes encapsulation and is commonly used in applications that require undo/redo functionality. By using the Memento pattern, you can enhance the flexibility and maintainability of your code.
