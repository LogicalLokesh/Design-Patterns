# State Pattern

The State pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior as its
internal state changes. It encapsulates states into separate classes, enabling the object to
dynamically change its behavior at runtime without resorting to complex conditional statements.

## Key Components

The State pattern involves the following key components:

Context: This is the object that contains the state and defines the interface through which clients
interact with the object. It maintains a reference to the current state object and delegates
state-specific behavior to that object.

- State: This is the interface or abstract class that defines the common methods for all
concrete states. Each concrete state class implements this interface and provides its own
implementation for the defined methods.

- Concrete States: These are the individual classes that represent specific states and
implement the State interface. Each concrete state class encapsulates the behavior
associated with a particular state.

## How It Works

The State pattern works as follows:

The Context object delegates state-specific behavior to the current state object referred
to by a State interface reference.

The state-specific behavior is encapsulated within the Concrete State classes, which implement
the methods defined by the State interface.

The Context object can change its current state by switching to a different Concrete State object.
This change typically occurs based on certain conditions or triggers.

Clients interact with the Context object through its interface, without being aware of the
state transitions or the specific concrete state objects.

## Benefits and Use Cases

The State pattern offers several benefits, including:

- Simplification of complex conditional statements: By encapsulating state-specific behavior
in separate classes, the State pattern eliminates the need for complex conditional statements
based on the object's state.

- Improved maintainability and extensibility: Adding new states and modifying existing state
behavior becomes easier as each state is encapsulated in a separate class.

- The State pattern is suitable when an object's behavior depends on its internal state, and
this behavior needs to change dynamically at runtime.

It is commonly used in various scenarios, such as:

- State machines or workflows, where an object goes through a series of states and transitions
based on external events or triggers.

- User interfaces, where different states may affect the behavior and appearance of UI components.

- Network protocols, where different states handle various aspects of communication and
protocol-specific operations.

Conclusion
The State pattern provides a flexible way to manage and change an object's behavior dynamically
based on its internal state. By encapsulating state-specific behavior in separate classes,
the State pattern promotes cleaner code and simplifies maintenance and extensibility.
It is particularly useful in scenarios where behavior changes based on states or triggers.
By applying the State pattern, you can achieve more flexible and modular designs.
